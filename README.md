# M5 Forecasting Analysis – Intermittent Demand Series

## Overview

This project analyzes selected intermittent demand series from the M5 dataset.  
The objective is to evaluate the performance of basic forecasting approaches on sparse time series and compare their predictive accuracy using multiple evaluation metrics.

---

## Forecasting Methods

The following forecasting methods were implemented:

- **Naïve Method**
- **Seasonal Naïve Method**
- **Prophet Model**

These methods were selected to provide a comparison between simple baseline approaches and a more flexible model capable of capturing trend and seasonality patterns.

---

## Evaluation Metrics

Model performance was evaluated using the following accuracy measures:

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE)**

Using multiple metrics allows for a more comprehensive assessment of forecast accuracy, particularly in the context of intermittent demand series where scale and error distribution can vary significantly.

## Results

The repository includes:

- Visualizations of selected intermittent demand series  
- Forecast vs. actual comparisons  
- Accuracy metric comparisons across models  

The results illustrate the challenges of forecasting intermittent demand and highlight differences in model performance under sparse data conditions.
