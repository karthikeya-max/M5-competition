## Series Characteristics (Original Series)

- **Total Observations:** 1941  
- **Number of Zero Values:** 970  
- **Percentage of Zeros:** 50.34%  

This series exhibits strong intermittency, with approximately half of the observations corresponding to zero demand. Such sparsity increases forecasting complexity and affects error stability across models.

## Cleaned Series Characteristics

- **Percentage of Zeros (Cleaned):** 43.26%  

After cleaning structural gaps, the zero proportion decreases, indicating improved continuity while still maintaining intermittent demand characteristics.
